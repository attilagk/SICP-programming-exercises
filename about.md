This is a compendium of solved problems centered at the principles computer programming.  All programming exercises were taken from [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs][book] (MIT Press), "widely considered a classic text in computer science" ([Wikipedia][wikipedia]).  The book, [as it states][ch1], uses the Scheme dialect of the Lisp language "as the framework for [...] discussion of programming" because "the language possesses unique features that make it an excellent medium for studying important programming constructs and data structures and for relating them to the linguistic features that support them".
